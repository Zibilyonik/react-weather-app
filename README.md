# React Weather App

This is a weather app project that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for a given city. The app is built using React and is a single page application.

The functionality of the app is as follows:
- The users can enter the name of a city in the search bar and click the search button to get the weather data for that city.
- The app will display the current weather data for the city, including the temperature , rainfall and relative humidity.
- The users can choose from a set of time windows (1 day by default) to get the weather data for that time window.
- The selected options for city and weather data will be dynamically displayed in the URL path.
  
## Setup
